                typographical errors), notice shall be deemed effective upon posting at Adavice Platform. In the event
                of material changes to the Terms and Conditions (i.e. affecting the rights and obligations of the
                parties), notice shall be effective upon delivery to the email address last provided by the Advertiser.
                In the event that the Advertiser believes that the Agreement is not being performed in accordance with
                the provisions of the Terms and Conditions, it may submit a complaint to Adavice in the term of 14
                (fourteen) days from noticing the breach of the Agreement by Adavice. All complaints will be handled
